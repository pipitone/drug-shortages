Drug Shortages
==============

Row {data-width=300}
--------------------

### Shortage Datasets
We have two sources of data on drug shortages: 

#### drugshortages.ca
- Active until March, 2017 
- Voluntary reporting
- We manually collected data from this database from 2013-04-01 through 2016-03-31 (`drugshortages.ca-manual.csv`)
- We also obtained exports of this database as of various dates (`drughsortages.ca-export.csv`)

#### drugshortagescanada.ca
- Active from March 2017 to present
- Mandatory reporting
- Exports provided on demand via [online search](https://www.drugshortagescanada.ca/search?term=&date_range%5Bdate_range_start%5D%5Bmonth%5D=&date_range%5Bdate_range_start%5D%5Bday%5D=&date_range%5Bdate_range_start%5D%5Byear%5D=&date_range%5Bdate_range_end%5D%5Bmonth%5D=&date_range%5Bdate_range_end%5D%5Bday%5D=&date_range%5Bdate_range_end%5D%5Byear%5D=&filter_type=shortages&filter_status=_all_)
- Note: The *anticipated shortage start date* is used if the start date is
  blank. If a shortage for the same DIN and start date appears in both datasets it
  is included once.

### Ingredient Groups
Ingredient Groups are taken from the [Drug Product Database](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database/terminology.html) 
active ingredient group number which identifies the unique groups of active
ingredients(s) regardless of strength. This is explained in more detail on the
"Drug Products" tab.

Drug Products
====================

Row {data-width=300}
-------------------- 

### Background
The Health Canada [Drug Product Database](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database.html) provides historical records of drug products (and provides [extracts](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database/what-data-extract-drug-product-database.html))

For the following charts, we only consider prescription drugs for humans. 

The DPD contains records tracking the change in a DINs status over time (in the `QRYM_STATUS`) table. Drug products are given a status of either: `APPROVED`, `MARKETED`, `CANCELLED POST-MARKET`, `CANCELLED PRE-MARKET`, or `DORMANT`.

The following chart shows, for each year, the number of drug products categorized by their status in that year. Drug product status in a year is taken from the most recent QRYM_STATUS entry to the year.

Innovator vs. Generics
===========================

Row {data-width=300}
--------------------

### Background 

In this section we look at innovator vs. generic drug products historically. To
determine whether a drug product is an innovator or generic we make the
assumption innovator drug products are always created before generic drug
products. Therefore in a group of drug products with the same active
ingredients, the earliest manufacturer is the innovator and all their drug
products in the group are marked as such. All other drug products, are marked as
generic.

[From the DPD page on Terminology](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database/terminology.html): 

"The AIG [Active Ingredient Group] number is a 10 digit number that identifies products that have the same active   ingredient(s) and ingredient strength(s). The AIG is comprised of three portions:

  - the first portion (2 digits) identifies the number of active ingredients
  - the second portion(5 digits) identifies the unique groups of active ingredients(s);
  - the last portion (3 digits) identifies the active ingredient group strength. The   strength group has a tolerance of -2% to +10%."

Innovator/Generic status is determined within groups determined by the second portion of the AIG only so that drug strength is ignored.

The following chart shows only the active drug products (`MARKETED`) over time.
